    title: Indistinguishable Sisters
    opening: "On a rainy day, a man went out dragging a large suitcase. At the door,
      he ran into his wife and happily exchanged a few words with her\u2014then his
      face suddenly twisted in horror. He looked carefully at her side profile, then
      at his watch, and finally glanced at the pouring rain outside. In panic, he
      dragged the suitcase and left the house, never to be seen again."
    answer: "The woman has an identical twin sister. The man was secretly having
      an affair with the sister. During their trysts, the sister drew a mole on her
      cheek to distinguish herself from the wife. Recently, the husband had grown
      tired of his wife and planned to murder her. One rainy day, thinking his wife
      was at work, he invited the sister over. Seeing the woman sitting on the sofa
      without a mole, he panicked\u2014believing his wife had come home early. Fearing
      exposure, he killed her, dismembered the body, and packed it in a suitcase.
      When he left home, he met a woman outside\u2014at first thinking it was his
      lover. After chatting happily for a moment, he noticed she also had no mole.
      Checking the time, he realized it was when his wife usually returned from work.
      Then it dawned on him: the woman he had killed inside was actually his lover\u2014the
      mole had been washed away by the rain. Terrified, he fled and disappeared forever."
    hints:
    - The key lies in the mole.
    - It was raining heavily that day.
    - The wife and her twin look identical.

    title: Red, Green, and White
    opening: "They looked perfect together, and he seemed happy\u2014but \u201Cgreen
      turned red into white.\u201D A fallen ring, a threatening proof, and the blurred
      remains became his obsession."
    answer: "A senior student had a girlfriend, and they looked perfect together.
      One day he bought a ring to propose (red \u2014 for marriage). On that day,
      a man attacked him, and the ring fell to the ground. Only then did he discover
      the girl was married to that man, an abusive husband. Her coworkers and parents
      all knew the truth but hid it, believing the student gave her hope. She became
      pregnant, and when the husband\u2014a long-distance truck driver\u2014realized
      the timeline didn\u2019t match, he knew he\u2019d been cheated on (green \u2014
      jealousy). The husband later extorted the student, even using the aborted fetus
      as \u201Cproof.\u201D The harassment never stopped, and one day while escaping
      the man, the student was hit by a car and died (white \u2014 funeral)."
    hints:
    - The colors red, green, and white symbolize wedding, jealousy, and death.
    - "The \u201Chusband\u201D being away for long trips is key."
